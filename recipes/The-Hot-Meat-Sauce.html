            <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
            <p>Is there anything better than a beautifully made plate of spaghetti and meat sauce? The answer to that question is yes! In order to improve upon this age old classic Jen and I decided to do what we always do and make it spicy. Smokey anaheim peppers, tangy jalapenos and a generous portion of red pepper flakes were added to our everyday sauce to create what we lovingly like to call "The Hot Meat Sauce". If you like your food to have a kick than look no further! As always, enjoying with friends and a nice glass of wine makes any dish better!</p>

            <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
