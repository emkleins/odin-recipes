            <p class="description">As two people who love both seafood and garlic, lots of it, Jen and I can simply not stay away from this recipe! Garlic roasted salmon filets really get the job done and are a cinch to make. Perfect for a date night in or a fast meal during the work week, this one will not steer you wrong. If you are looking for paring options this dish is fantastic with a bottle of white white wine and some crispy brussels. Enjoy the feast!</p>

                <li>2 tsp Salt</li>

                <li>1 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>6 tbsp salted butter</li>
                <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tsp parsley</li>

            <ol class="instructions">
                <li><strong>Season Salmon:</strong> Take salmon out of fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes</li>
                <li><strong>Sear Salmon 3 mins:</strong> Heat oil and 2 cloves of garlic in large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. When garlic is lightly roasted add salmon, presentation side (i.e. curved side) down, and cook for 3 minutes until golden.</li>
                <li><strong>Turn, cook 1 min, then add butter:</strong> Turn salmon and cook the skin side for 1 minute. <em>Then</em> put butter in</li>
                <li><strong>Baste 1 1/2 minutes:</strong> Once butter is melted and foaming, add garlic and <em>immediately</em> start spooning the bubbling butter continuously over the salmon for 1 1/2 minutes. To do this, tilt the pan slightly so the butter pools on one side. Using a large spoon, scoop the butter up and coat the filets in it.</li>
                <li><strong>Remove salmon from stove:</strong> Check internal temperature of salmon. It should be 50&#176C/122&#176F for medium-rare (optimum juiciness pull temp). Remove salmon to a plate. Rest for 3 minutes - it will rise to 53&#176C/127&#176F.</li>
                <li><strong>Add lemon juice to butter:</strong> Put pan back on unlit stove to keep butter hot. Add lemon juice.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Place salmon on serving plates. Spoon over butter (be judicious, it's rich!), garnish with a sprinkle of parsley.</li>
