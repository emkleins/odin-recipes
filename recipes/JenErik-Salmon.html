            <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
            <p>As two people who love both seafood and garlic, lots of it, Jen and I can simply not stay away from this recipe! Garlic roasted salmon filets really get the job done and are a cinch to make. Perfect for a date night in or a fast meal during the work week, this one will not steer you wrong. If you are looking for paring options this dish is fantastic with a bottle of white wine and some crispy brussels. Enjoy the feast!</p>
